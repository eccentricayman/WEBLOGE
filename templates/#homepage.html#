  <!--  Dab. (A dab, is a when a person uses their arms to point in one direction, slightly above their heads; a &ldquo;good&rdquo; dab is occurs when the movement of the arms is almost instant, and they are parallel when the dab is completed). Now, why is this weird? Firstly, its a dance move. You don&rsquo;t see people just randomly busting a dance move in public to no music for about one second. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen and when it does, you assume the one doing it is drunk. Secondly, the moment someone does it, it is followed by either &ldquo;some sick dab bro&rdquo; or &ldquo;eeeeeshhhhhhhhhh, that dab was terrible! This is how you dab&rdquo;. Like, why not say &ldquo;why did you dab to no music? You just did it to get a reaction out of us; we understand that you are not talking at the moment but do not worry, we have not forgotten you exist; you do not need to dab to get our attention&rdquo;. Thirdly, it is used as a form of celebration (yeah I know it originated from a touch-down celebration dance) but for pretty pathetic reasons; you got to school just on time? Dab. Did you got an hour detention when you actually expected a three hour detention? Dab. Did you say something slightly funny? Dab so people laugh. Did you just finish what is supposed to a professional presentation? Dab so people remember that your presentation as &ldquo;at the end, the guy dabbed&rdquo;. So yeah, dabbing is pretty weird. Granted, I&rsquo;ve seen people shuffle across the floor in public, as well as get on top of their car and sing in the middle of an intersection. But dabbing is just really weird to me.Dab.
